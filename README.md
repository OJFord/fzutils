# fzutils

Command line utilities leveraging [fzf](//github.com/junegunn/fzf).

I've been asked a few times to elaborate on my fzf git aliases when I've mentioned them, so I've extracted them here from my dotfiles to have an easier thing to point at in future; and a convenient place to which to gradually move other or create new scripts building on @junegunn's awesome `fzf`.

## Installation

Plop the directory somewhere on your `$PATH`.

For example:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/OJFord/fzutils
$ export PATH="$PWD/fzutils:$PATH"
```

## Usage

See the `-h`/`--help` of individual utils.

## Contributing

Sure, thanks!
